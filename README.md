# Formula Sheets
A collection of formula sheets I've used at my time in UBC

Adapted from [this great template](https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/).

## Editing

To edit this formula sheet, you will need to download the appropriate `.tex` file and open it in your favorite LaTeX edting software (I used [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) for this, but [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a nice online solution).
